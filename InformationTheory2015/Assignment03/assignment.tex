Being too stringent with the definition of typical sequences 

\paragraph{Problem 1} \footnote{This problem explains why we had to go through all those
epsilons to get a good idea of what a typical sequence means.}

Consider a DNA sequence of length 8 generated iid from the distribution 
    
$$ \wp(A, T, G, C) = (\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{8})$$

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the single most probable sequence? What is its probability of
        occurrence?
        \paragraph{solution} The most probable sequence is $AAAAAAAA$ with
        probability of occurrence $\frac{1}{2^8}$.

    \item How many stringently typical sequences are there (exact answer
        required)?  

    \item. What is the total probability of getting some stringently typical
        sequence?

    \item Redo the whole calculation if the length is 16. What is the total
        probability of getting a stringently typical sequence? Are we converging
        to 1?  

\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Entropy rate of a Markov process}

The Morse code uses dots, dashes, and two types of spaces: letter and word
spaces.  Spaces only occur as delimiters; that is, no space can follow another
space. What is the entropy rate achievable under these constraints?  Hint: take
a look at Shannonâ€™s 1948 paper for a start, and Example 5.1.3 of C\&T, but use
different notation. Write it out as a Markov process whose states are [.], [-],
[L-space], [W-space]. Assume that all allowed outputs from any state are equally
likely.  

\paragraph{[Optional][C\&T 3.11] Read the C\&T section 4.3, Entropy Rate of a
    Random Walk}  What is the entropy rate of rooks, kings, and bishops on a 3x3
chessboard?  Remember there are 2 types of bishops.
