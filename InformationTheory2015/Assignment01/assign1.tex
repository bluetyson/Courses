\section{Problem 1}

Consider a horse race where the probabilities of winning are given by negative
powers of 2 (1/2, 1/32, etc.). Suppose the lowest possible probability for any
horse is $2^{-m}$ , and that there are $n_i$ horses in each probability class $2^i$.

\begin{itemize}
    \item What equation must the $n_i$ satisfy?  
    \item Give 3 possible sets of $\{n_i\}$ for an 8 horse race (other than the
        uniform case).
    \item Using the entropy concept, calculate the expected codeword length for
        each set.
    \item For each set, present an efficient binary coding scheme that achieves
        optimality.
\end{itemize}
