\problem{Coding}

Consider a horse race where the probabilities of winning are given by negative
powers of 2 ($\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{32}$, etc.). Suppose the lowest possible
probability for any horse is $2^{-m}$ , and that there are $n_i$ horses in each
probability class $2^{-i}$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What equation must the $n_i$ satisfy?  
    \item Give 3 possible sets of $\{n_i\}$ for an 8 horse race (other than the
        uniform case).
    \item Using the entropy concept, calculate the expected codeword length for
        each set.
    \item For each set, present an efficient binary coding scheme that achieves
        optimality.
\end{enumerate}

\solution

\part 

Since lowest probability of any horse winning is $\frac{1}{2^m} \implies i \leq
m$. Moreover, the probability of any horse winning a race must be 1 i.e. $
\sum_{i=1}^{i \leq m} \frac{1}{2^i} n_i = 1 $

\part

Let the horses are indexed $H_0, H_1, \ldots H_7$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $ \{ H_0 \}, \{ H_1, H_5, H_7 \}, \{ H_2, H_3, H_4, H_6 \} $
\end{enumerate}
