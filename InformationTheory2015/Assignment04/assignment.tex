\problem{Decoding}

Consider the following set of codewords:

(A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H) = (01, 11, 001, 0000, 0001, 1001, 1010, 1011).

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Is this an instantaneous (prefix) code?
    \item Verify that it satisfies the Kraft inequality.
    \item Construct a string which has no meaning under this system Transmitting
        information across a channel.
\end{enumerate}

\solution

\part 

Yes. Function {\tt solvea} figures out if any code is a prefix of any other
code. The answer is that there is no code which prefix of any other code. Some
relevant snippet from the code is following.

\begin{verbatim}
*Main> alphabets 
"ABCDEFGH"
*Main> allcodes 
["01","11","001","0000","0001","1001","1010","1011"]
*Main> map isPrefixCode alphabets 
[False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False]
\end{verbatim}

\part

Function {\tt kraft } verifies that it is true. Following is the execution.

\begin{verbatim}
*Main> kraft_sum 
0.9375
*Main> kraft
True
*Main> 
\end{verbatim}

\part

Any string which function {\tt decoder} can't decode would have no meaning. Here
are some examples:

\begin{verbatim}
*Main> decode "101000101" 
"GCA"
*Main> decode "101000101111" 
"GCAB*** Exception: No valid alphabet for "1"
*Main> decode "1010001011110" 
"GCAB*** Exception: No valid alphabet for "10"
*Main> 
\end{verbatim}

\problem{} Consider the discrete memoryless channel Y = X + Z (mod 11), where Z
is uniformly distributed on the alphabet {1, 2, 3}, and $X \in \{0, 1, \ldots
10\}$ . Assume that Z is independent of X.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the capacity.
    \item What is the maximizing $p^\star(x)$?
\end{enumerate}

\solution

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{channel.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Channel with their input and output symbols.}
\end{figure}


\part During coding, any $x \in X$ goes to $x+1, x+2, x+3$ (mod 11) with
probability 1/3. This channel is very similar to noisy typewriter channel. Two
consider two possibilities, we can send either \{0, 3, 6, 9\} with a chance that
$9 \rightarrow 1$ and $0 \rightarrow 1$. Or we can drop 0 or 9 from the set. In
the former, we can send one of 4 symbols per transmission with a small
probability of error (i.e. $9 \rightarrow 1$ and $0 \rightarrow 1$); in later
case, we
can send one of the 3 symbols per transmission without any error but we will
never send some symbols. None of these situations are desirable but we now know
the limit on channel capacity, between $log_2 4 = 2$ and $log_2 3 = 1.5849$. In
fact the python simulator attached in appendix computes it to be approximately
$1.78$.

\footnote{Solve if one partition the scheme in a way that there is no
    collision}.

\problem{}

The Z channel has binary input and output alphabets and transition
probabilities $p(y|x)$ given by the following matrix: Q =

\begin{tabular}{c c c}
 & 1 &  0 \\
 &1/2 & 1/2 \\
\end{tabular}

$x, y \in \{0, 1\}$.

[Why is it called the Z-channel?]
Find the capacity of the Z channel and the maximizing input probability distribution.

\problem{}

[Optional] For the Z channel of the previous problem, assume that we choose a
($2^{nR}$) code at random, where each codeword is a sequence of fair coin
tosses. This will not achieve capacity. Find the maximum rate R such that the
probability of error $P_e^n$ , averaged over randomly generated codes, tends to
zero as the block length n tends to infinity.
