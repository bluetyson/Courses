Decoding

1. Consider the following set of codewords:
(A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H) = (01, 11, 001, 0000, 0001, 1001, 1010, 1011).

a. Is this an instantaneous (prefix) code?
b. Verify that it satisfies the Kraft inequality
c. Construct a string which has no meaning under this system
Transmitting information across a channel

2. [C&T 8.5] Consider the discrete memoryless channel 𝑌 = 𝑋 + 𝑍  (𝑚𝑜𝑑  11), where 𝑍
is uniformly distributed on the alphabet {1, 2, 3}:
𝑍=

1
2
3
,
1/3 1/3 1/3

and 𝑋 ∈ {0, 1, … , 10}. Assume that 𝑍 is independent of 𝑋.
a. Find the capacity.
b. What is the maximizing 𝑝∗ (𝑥)?
3. [C&T 8.9] The Z channel has binary input and output alphabets and transition
probabilities 𝑝(𝑦|𝑥) given by the following matrix:
𝑄=

1
0
1/2 1/2

𝑥, 𝑦 ∈ {0, 1}.

[Why is it called the Z-channel?]
Find the capacity of the Z channel and the maximizing input probability distribution.
4. [Optional][C&T 8.10] For the Z channel of the previous problem, assume that we
choose a (2!" , 𝑛) code at random, where each codeword is a sequence of fair coin
tosses. This will not achieve capacity. Find the maximum rate R such that the
(!)
probability of error 𝑃! , averaged over randomly generated codes, tends to zero as
the block length n tends to infinity.
