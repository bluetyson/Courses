1. Large deviation theory. We roll a fair six-sided die 𝑛 times, where 𝑛 is large. What is
the probability that the number of 2s is at least double the number of 1s in the
resulting string? Of strings which satisfy this condition, what proportion of values
will be 1s?
We can split this calculation into the following parts:
a. What is the constraint equation for the set 𝐸 of types (or empirical distributions)
𝑃! ! which satisfy the required condition?
b. Let 𝑄 be the uniform distribution. Show that the member 𝑃∗ of 𝐸 which minimizes
the relative entropy 𝐷(𝑃∗ ||𝑄) is the maximum entropy distribution subject to the
constraints from (a).
c. Find the distribution 𝑃∗ . E.g. let the proportion of 1s be an unknown 𝑥. Use some
intuition to set the rest of the distribution. Then use calculus to minimize. You can
find the answer analytically.
d. What is the probability that the outcome of 𝑛 die rolls belongs to 𝑃∗ (and therefore,
to 𝐸 to first order in the exponent)?
e. (Optional) Verify your answer for n = 250 by Monte Carlo simulation.
