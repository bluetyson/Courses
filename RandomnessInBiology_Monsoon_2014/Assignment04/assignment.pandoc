# 1.  Equation of velocity

$$ 
\Delta x = \frac{dx}{dt} \Delta t \\
\Delta v = (-\Gamma v/m)\Delta t + \alpha \sqrt{2 \Gamma kT/m^2} \sqrt{\Delta t}
$$

We simulated this equation and calculated the trajectories of randm walk. For
initial velocities 0 and 10, and step size of 0.1,0.01,0.001; we calculated 5
trajectories for each case. Which are following.
