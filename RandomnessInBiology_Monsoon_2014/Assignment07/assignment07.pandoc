## Genetic switch 

Following differential equation describes a protein which activates its own
protein.

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{v_0 + v_1 K_1 K_2 x^2}{1 + K_1 K_2 x^2} - \gamma x$$

For given values, the equation turns into:

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{12.5 + 200 K_1K_2 x^2}{1 + K_1 K_2 x^2} -  x$$

## Steady state solution without any noise.
