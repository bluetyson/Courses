Let me start with solutions from assignment submission. 

\section{Drawing without replacement} 

We have a jar with $N$ balls, out of which $b$ are blue and rest are red. I draw
a ball at random but do not put it back.  Clearly it is not a Markovian process
since at each step the probability of drawing red (or blue) ball is changing. At
time zero probability of drawing a blue ball is $\frac{b}{N}$. The probability
of drawing blue ball at next step is either $\frac{b-1}{N-1}$ if drew blue ball
or $\frac{b}{N-1}$ if I drew red ball now. I can define states in the process.
Let say they are {\tt BLUE\_DRAWN} and {\tt RED\_DRAWN}. The transition graph of
this process will look like the following.

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1, every node/.style={circle}, inner sep=5pt ]
    \node[fill=blue] (blue) {};
    \node[fill=red, right=of blue] (red)  {};
    \draw[very thick,->] (blue) to[bend right] (red);
    \draw[very thick,->] (red) to[bend right] (blue);
    \draw[very thick,->] (red) edge[loop right] (red);
    \draw[very thick,->] (blue) edge[loop left] (blue);
    
\end{tikzpicture}    

Where arrow in graph shows the transition to head state given system is in tail
state now. For example, \tikz{ \node[fill=red,circle] (red) {};
\node[fill=blue,circle,right=of red ] (blue) {}; \draw[->] (red) -- node[above]
{$p$} (blue) } depicts the process of drawing blue ball given that red was drawn
just before. The number on arrow $p$ is the probability of this transition. I
leave it upto you to write the transition matrix for this system using these two
states and convince yourself that this is not Markovian.

\paragraph{Converting {\bf this} system to Markovian}  To do so, we introduce
another state: a {\tt NULL} state. Whenever we take away drawn ball from jar,
the value in {\tt NULL} increases by 1. The challenge is to write down the
transition graph (or matrix) and show that now the system has become Markovian.
Mind you, we should be able to the solution of previous system from this system
as well (otherwise we have changed the system).
