# Problem 1

>What will be the effect of blocking contra-lateral inhibition on the hind limb
>motor pattern? Draw a normal motor pattern and compare this with the pattern
>seen after blocking contralateral inhibition. 

# Problem 2

>You have expressed channel rhodopsin in V3 interneurons. Assume that during an
>ongoing walking motor pattern V3s are silent. You then illuminate with blue
>light. What will happen to the motor pattern? Draw the motor patterns before,
>during and after the light stimulus.

# Problem 3

>You are writing a research grant on Huntingtonâ€™s disease. Choose any model
>system. Explain why. Your experiments must involve assaying of electrical
>activity. You choose the method. Write a one page proposal (Aim, Methods,
>Interpretation).
