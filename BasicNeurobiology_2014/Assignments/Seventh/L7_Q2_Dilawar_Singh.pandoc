# Problem 
You are interested in the input-output relationship of a particular graded
chemical synapse. You would like to characterize how the voltage change in the
postsynaptic cell depends upon the amount of depolarization in the presynaptic
cell. Using intracellular electrodes, you depolarize the presynaptic cell by
various voltage steps and record the postsynaptic EPSP (using TTX to block
APâ€™s). You discover that there is a sigmoidal relationship between pre- and
post-synaptic potential as shown in the figure. 

a. Suggest two possible reasons for the plateau reached with increasing
presynaptic depolarization.  

b. Suggest an experiment that would allow you to determine which, if either, of
your hypotheses is correct.

# Answers

The sigmoid curve has three regions: < 10 mV region where the relationship is
rather linear; > -10 mV but < 10 mV where relationship is also "linear" but the
slope is extremely steep, a small change in presynaptic voltage causes a great
change in postsynaptic voltage; and > 10 mV where the relationship is linear but
saturated, no amount of presynaptic voltage changes the postsynaptic voltage.

We can conclude following.

- In region < -10mV, a channel or group of channels are active with constant
conductance.

- At -10 mV, another channel or group of channels with much higher conductances
opens and contribute to the postsynaptic potential.

- After +10 mV, no new channels opens and old channels saturates.

### a

1. All active channels at +10mV reaches their maximum conductances. or,
2. New channels opens just before +10mV and current flows in opposite directions
in these new channels as compared to the previously opened one. The commulative
effect on increase of EPSP become zero at 0mV.

### b

First we should check that new channels are being opened or not.
